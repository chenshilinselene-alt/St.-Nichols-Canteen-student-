# Overview

Auntie Jenny is a school food preorder application that allows students to browse a menu of food items and place orders for pickup. The application features a modern React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend, designed specifically for school canteen environments. Students can view menu items with customizable modifiers (like portion sizes), add items to their cart, choose serving preferences for combined items, and complete orders with PayLah! payment integration and estimated pickup times.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client-side application is built with React and TypeScript, utilizing a component-based architecture with the following key decisions:

- **Routing**: Uses Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: Combines React Query for server state management with a custom cart store using localStorage for persistence
- **UI Framework**: Implements shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives for accessible, customizable components
- **Styling**: Uses Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming and design consistency
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

The cart functionality is implemented as a reactive store pattern that persists data locally and provides real-time updates across components. The application includes intelligent serving preferences that appear when students order both rice and dumplings, allowing them to choose between combined or separate serving. The application follows a mobile-first responsive design approach with improved spacing and visual hierarchy.

## Backend Architecture
The server follows a RESTful API design using Express.js with TypeScript:

- **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints for menu items and order management
- **Data Layer**: Abstracted storage interface with in-memory implementation for development
- **Request Handling**: Express middleware for JSON parsing, CORS, and request logging
- **Development**: Integrated Vite development server with hot module replacement

The backend implements a storage abstraction pattern, allowing for easy migration from in-memory storage to persistent databases. The API provides endpoints for menu retrieval, item updates, and order creation.

## Data Storage Solutions
Currently uses an in-memory storage implementation with predefined menu data including:

- **Menu Items**: Rice, dumplings, and stir fry dishes with base prices and descriptions
- **Modifiers**: Portion sizes and variations with associated pricing
- **Orders**: Student information, items, and pickup times
- **Database Schema**: Designed with Drizzle ORM for future PostgreSQL integration

The schema is structured to support hierarchical relationships between menu items and their modifiers, with order tracking capabilities.

## Form Handling and Validation
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form for efficient form state and validation
- **Schema Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type checking and validation
- **UI Feedback**: Toast notifications for user feedback and error handling

# External Dependencies

## Database and ORM
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database toolkit configured for PostgreSQL
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL for production deployment
- **Database Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management and migrations

## UI and Styling
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives for complex UI interactions
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework with custom design system
- **shadcn/ui**: Pre-built component library with consistent styling
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent iconography

## Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across frontend and backend
- **Vite**: Development server and build tool with plugin ecosystem
